## Build ##

- Use ```go get``` to get the missing wheels.
- Look at [wheelmodified.md](https://github.com/wasupandceacar/osu-vs-player/blob/master/wheelmodified.md) to see my code modifications for used wheels. For some modifications I've merged it to original repo, while for others you should learn them and modify the wheels, otherwise NO hope for build success.
- Change the code folder name to ```danser``` —— because I import module using ```danser/xxx```.
- Look at [build.md](https://github.com/wasupandceacar/osu-vs-player/blob/master/build.md) to learn how to build.
- You may enconuter rsrc build error, but the built exe will still run.
