## Build ##

- Use ```go get``` to get the missing wheels.
- Look at [wheelmodified.md](https://github.com/wasupandceacar/osu-vs-player/blob/master/wheelmodified.md) to know my code modifications for used wheels. For some modifications I've merged it to original repo, while for others you should learn them and modify the wheels, otherwise no hope for build success.
- Look at [build.md](https://github.com/wasupandceacar/osu-vs-player/blob/master/build.md) to learn how to build.
